# Website experiment

This repository contains the code for the website experiment.

The website experiment was conducted to test the effects of different types of language on human perceptions of trust and cognitive effort. The experiment was conducted online, and participants were asked to interact with a chatbot that was designed to provide legal advice. The chatbot used different types of language, including formal and informal language, and personal and impersonal pronouns. Participants were then asked to rate their perceptions of the chatbot's trustworthiness and helpfulness, as well as their own cognitive effort.

The results of the experiment showed that participants who interacted with a chatbot that used informal language and personal pronouns perceived the chatbot as more trustworthy and helpful. They also reported lower cognitive effort. These findings suggest that the type of language used by a chatbot can affect human perceptions of trust and cognitive effort.
