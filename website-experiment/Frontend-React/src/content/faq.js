         <li>Generally, there are no limits on how much a landlord can charge as a security deposit. Landlords usually charge one or two months' rent. But, there are some exceptions:</li>
          <div style="margin-left: 25px;" class="circle">
         <li>Subsidized or public housing: Landlords can only charge a deposit similar to deposits being charged by private landlords in the area.</li>

         <li>Suburban Cook County: Landlords cannot charge more than one and a half month's rent.</li>

         <li>Note: Sometimes landlords charge a move-in fee instead of a security deposit. A move-in fee is not a security deposit and does not have the same protections as a security deposit. A move-in fee is usually non-refundable. However, if the move-in fee is a large amount, similar to the amount of 1x or 2x times the monthly rent, then it can be considered a security deposit.</li>
