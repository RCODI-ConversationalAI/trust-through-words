You rented an apartment at **233 South Wacker, Chicago, IL 60606** from Larry Landlord. It is a large building with more than 40 units. You moved in on **August 25, 2021,** and moved out completely on **August 24, 2022**. No rent is owed; you paid it all on time. You provided your landlord your new address.

You had a written lease with your landlord for $2,250 per month and a security deposit of $2,000. You still have a copy of the lease.

On **October 1, 2022**, your former landlord in writing (by email) said that the kitchen floor had been damaged and needed to be repaired. He says the damage was beyond normal wear and tear, but you do not agree. He gave you a rough estimate of $3,000 to replace the kitchen floor, and said that he would keep the full amount of your security deposit. Your former landlord did not send receipts.

Getting back as much of the security deposit as possible would be very helpful for you.

First, you want to know if you can get all or some of your security deposit back from your landlord.

Second, if you are entitled to the return of all or some of your security deposit, you want to know what you need to do to get your security deposit back.
