### Welcome

In this experiment you will help us understand the interactions between humans and chatbots in a legal setting. This project is performed as a collaborative effort between Dr. Sabine Brunswicker, RCODI, Purdue University and Daniel W. Linna Jr., InnovationLab, Northwestern University.

If you choose to participate, you will be directed to an approximately 30-minute online task. The task will consist of 15 minutes interacting with online help to solve a hypothetical legal problem. You will then complete a 15-minute survey about your experience using the technology.

You will have one hour to complete the experiment. After one hour, you will have the opportunity to extend your time by another 30 minutes. You will receive a reminder when you have 15 minutes left.

You will receive the $8.75 payment only if you fully complete the experiment. Partial payments will not be made.
