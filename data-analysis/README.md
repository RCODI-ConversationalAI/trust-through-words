## Analyses

The following statistical analyses were conducted:

- **Descriptive statistics:** Descriptive statistics were generated to summarize the data.
- **Sampling analyses:** Sampling analyses were conducted to ensure that the data was representative of the population.
- **Type error analysis:** Type error analysis was conducted to identify and correct any errors in the data.
- **Interaction plots:** Interaction plots were generated to visualize the relationships between variables.
- **MANCOVA:** MANCOVA analyses were conducted to examine the effects of different factors on multiple dependent variables.
- **Lexical parsing:** Lexical parsing was conducted to analyze the text data.
- **EQ summary statistics:** Summary statistics were generated for the EQ measure.
- **Expert human evaluation:** Data from the expert human evaluation was analyzed.
- **Sensitivity analyses:** Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the findings.
- **CFA:** CFA was conducted to assess the validity of the measurement model.
- **Loadings to weights:** Loadings were converted to weights for use in subsequent analyses.
- **PCA:** PCA was conducted to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
- **Pretest analyses:** Pretest analyses were conducted to assess the feasibility of the study.
- **Statistical tests:** Various statistical tests were conducted to examine the relationships between variables.
